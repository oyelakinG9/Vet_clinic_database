# VET CLINIC
> Vet clinic project based on the POSTGRE SQL DATABASE (STRUCTURED);
> It is used to store animals history profile in a vet clinic hospital;


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**


- Open SQL Shell and perform the following query operations
SELECT * FROM animals;

> BEGIN;

> UPDATE animals SET species='unspecified';

> SELECT * FROM animals;

> ROLLBACK;

> UPDATE animals SET species='digimon' WHERE name LIKE '%mon%';

> SELECT * FROM animals;

> UPDATE animals SET species='pokemon' WHERE species IS NULL;

> BEGIN;

> DELETE FROM animals;

> ROLLBACK;

> DELETE FROM animals WHERE date_of_birth > '2022-01-01';

> BEGIN;

> SAVEPOINT savepoint_01;

> UPDATE animals SET weight_kg = weight_kg * -1;

> ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_01;

> UPDATE animals SET weight_kg = weight_kg * -1 WHERE weight_kg < 0;

> COMMIT;

/* Also query the following operations */

> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM animals;

> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM animals WHERE escape_attempts = 0;

> SELECT AVG(weight_kg) FROM animals;

> SELECT neutered, AVG(escape_attempts) AS Avg_attempt_ascape FROM animals GROUP BY neutered;

> SELECT species, MIN(weight_kg), MAX(weight_kg) FROM animals GROUP BY species;

> SELECT species, AVG(escape_attempts) FROM animals WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '2000-12-31' GROUP BY species;
